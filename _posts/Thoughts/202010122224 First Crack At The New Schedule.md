Today was the first day of the new schedule. Overall it went pretty well. I only did 2 track finishing sessions instead of 3 because I had some technical problems with exporting WAVs from Bitwig.

I also have some work to do making sure I have a set procedure for uploading my tracks to Soundcloud, especially regarding what images and tags and other meta data I am using. There was far too many decisions to make there to just do it super quick.

I found the 30 minute sessions flew by super fast, and I wanted to spend a lot more time on those tracks, but keeping the sessions so short forced me to only do the specific tasks that I had already set my self from the previous listening session.

I also didn't end up doing any of the admin work of updating my notes during the work sessions, and am only getting it done now later in the evening, but I'm just putting that down to the fact that I don't have everything setup yet. I need to get Obsidian and Sourcetree installed onto my studio PC so I can update the knowledge base in the studio without having to switch computers.

To Do:
- Prepare a selection of images ready to go for Soundcloud uploads. Especially making sure they will look good when cropped by the website embed.
- Have pre-set values for all meta-data fields for Soundcloud, including a selection of tags to use
- Install Obsidian and Sourcetree on Mechanucleus
