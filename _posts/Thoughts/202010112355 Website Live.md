# Website Live

Today is the day that I actually pushed this website live at huntingmirages.com. it's pretty basic right now and there are a lot of things missing, bit I was keen to get it up so I can get started with my new publishing workflow.

So far it's just a list of blog posts on a Timeline, and you can click on each post to see the whole post alone on it's own page ...and that's it.

Stuff still to do.
- About and contact page
- Links to my YouTube and SoundCloud channels
- Mailing list sign up
- Historical entries for my Vlogs
- Historical entries for all my work in progress tracks

There's a lot more to come but those are the glaring omissions for now.
